## The Golden Rule: 

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

### HTML Elements
-- section containing your player in a div, player health in a div with span over hp
--section containing add goblin function with input box and add goblin button
--section containing goblins to fight with two goblins loaded in by default.

### app.js

-- grab dom elements for event listeners and state change
-- state for hp of player and goblins
-- submit event listener for new goblins that randomize hp
-- click event for goblins that decides if character successfully hit goblin or not
